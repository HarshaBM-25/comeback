üå± IoT Smart Farming System ‚Äì README
Overview

The IoT Smart Farming System is a complete smart agriculture solution designed to help farmers monitor, automate, and predict farm conditions. It integrates real-time sensors, automation, cloud connectivity, mobile access, and yield prediction to optimize water usage, save electricity, and improve crop management. The system can also be connected to regional agricultural offices for expert guidance and large-scale monitoring.

Features
1. Real-Time Monitoring

Temperature & Humidity (DHT11/DHT22)

Gas Levels (MQ135)

Soil Moisture

Water Level in hydroponic or irrigation systems

2. Automation

Automatic irrigation using relays + NodeMCU

Triggers irrigation based on soil moisture and water level readings

3. Mobile App for Farmers

Real-time monitoring of farm conditions on Android/iOS

Alerts and notifications about low water, dry soil, or high gas levels

Easy-to-use, farmer-friendly interface in local language

4. Regional Agricultural Office Software

Monitors multiple farms in real-time

Aggregates sensor data and predicts regional and farm-level yield

Provides advisories, alerts, and resource planning for farmers

Helps policymakers make data-driven decisions for irrigation, subsidies, and crop management
